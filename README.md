# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Use npm install to install all the necessary dependencies

The Api key can be set in an environment variable in the root folder as REACT_APP_OpenAi_Key.
(I was stuck on this for a while before reading the docs always include REACT_APP else it will be ignored)
### `npm start`

Running npm start runs the app locally

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
